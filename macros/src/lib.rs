/// Instrumentation macro for memory allocators.
///
/// This macro allows to trace memory allocations/reallocations/frees in order to determine which
/// portion of the codebase consume the most memory, and to help finding memory leaks.
///
/// The macro takes the following attributes:
/// - `name`: the name of the allocator
/// - `op`: the operation the function performs (either `alloc`, `realloc` or `free`)
/// - `ptr` (required for `realloc` and `free`): the field specifying the pointer
/// - `size` (required for `alloc` and `free`): the field specifiying the size of the allocation
/// - `scale` (optional, defaults to `linear`): the scale of the allocation, either:
///     - `linear`: the size is taken as is in the recorded sample
///     - `log2`: the size is put to the power of two (`2^^n`) before begin recordedsaved in the
///    sample
///
/// Example:
/// ```rust
/// #[instrument_allocator(name = buddy, op = alloc, size = order, scale = log2)]
/// ```

/// registers.
