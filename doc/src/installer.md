# Installer

Since the kernel cannot run by itself, the [installer](https://github.com/llenotre/maestro-install) can be used to build it.

The utility on the installer's repository produces an ISO file which can be run on a virtual or physical machine to install the operating system on it.

For more information, check the documentation of the installer on its repository.
