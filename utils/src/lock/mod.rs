//! This module implements locks, useful to prevent race conditions in
//! multithreaded code for example.
//!
//! Mutual exclusion is used to protect data from concurrent access.
//!
//! A `Mutex` allows to ensure that one, and only thread accesses the data stored
//! into it at the same time. Preventing race conditions. They usually work
//! using spinlocks.
//!
//! One particularity with kernel development is that multi-threading is not the
//! only way to get concurrency issues. Another factor to take into account is
//! that fact that an interruption may be triggered at any moment while
//! executing the code unless disabled. For this reason, mutexes in the kernel
//! are equipped with an option allowing to disable interrupts while being
//! locked.
//!
//! If an exception is raised while a mutex that disables interruptions is
//! acquired, the behaviour is undefined.
