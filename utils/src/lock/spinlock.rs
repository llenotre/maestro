//! This module contains the Spinlock structure, which is considered as being a

/// A spinlock is a lock that is used to prevent a specific piece of code from
/// being accessed by more than one thread at a time.
///
/// It works by storing a value telling whether a thread is already in that piece of code.
///
/// To avoid race conditions, the implementation uses an atomic exchange instruction to
/// check/lock the structure. If a threads tries to lock the structure while
/// already being locked, the thread shall wait in a loop (spin) until the
/// structure is unlocked.
///
/// Special attention must be aimed toward the usage of this structure since it
/// can easily result in deadlocks if misused.

	/// this function. Otherwise, data races might happen.
