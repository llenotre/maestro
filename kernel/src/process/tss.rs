//! Under the x86 architecture, the TSS (Task State Segment) is a structure that
//! is mostly deprecated but that must still be used in order to perform
//! software context switching because it allows to store the pointers to the
//! stacks to use whenever an interruption happens and requires switching the
//! protection ring, and thus the stack.
//!
//! The structure has to be registered into the GDT into the TSS segment, and must be loaded using
//! instruction `ltr`.
