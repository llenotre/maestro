//! A signal handler trampoline is the function that handles returning from a signal handler.
//!
//! The trampoline is using the same stack as the normal process execution.
//!
//! When the signal handler returns, the process returns directly to execution.

use crate::syscall::SIGRETURN_ID;
use core::arch::asm;

/// The signal handler trampoline.
///
/// The process resumes to this function when it received a signal.
/// Thus, this code is executed in userspace.
///
/// When the process finished handling the signal, it calls the `sigreturn`
/// system call in order to tell the kernel to resume normal execution.
///
/// Arguments:
/// - `handler` is a pointer to the handler function for the signal.
/// - `sig` is the signal number.
