//! The memory is one of the main component of the system.

//! The system's memory is divided in two chunks:
//! - Userspace: Virtual memory below `PROCESS_END`, used by the currently running process
//! - Kernelspace: Virtual memory above `PROCESS_END`, used by the kernel itself and shared accross
//! processes
